    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder, and salt. Add chicken pieces and marinate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for best flavor).</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until soft and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and ginger and cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce and simmer for 10–15 minutes, until thickened slightly.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, cook the marinated chicken until browned and mostly cooked through. Add to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour in the heavy cream and stir to combine. Simmer everything together for 10 more minutes until chicken is fully cooked and the sauce is creamy and rich.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt to taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with basmati rice or warm naan.</li>
    </ol>
